# An-R-Package-for-Feature-Screening-with-Large-Scale-and-High-Dimensional-Survival-Data
Built on survival analysis foundations (Cox 1972, 1975), Yi, He, and Carroll (2022) proposed the MCCL model-based screening for NP-dimensional survival data with large $n$, leveraging the Coxâ€“logistic link to efficiently discard irrelevant covariates. We implemented this method as the R package MCCLmethod.
